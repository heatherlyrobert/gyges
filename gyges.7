.SH IMAGERY (see HERITAGE at bottom for more)
ugly, impossibly powerful, one-hundred handed, fifty headed giant

.SH SUMMARY
gyges (j-eye-j-ees) is a light, clean, powerful, technical, aesthetic, and
keyboard-centric console spreadsheet focused on functionality, analytics,
interfacing, scripting, and tailored usage.

.SH SCOPE, REASONING and DECISION

.B situation (S).  
spreadsheets are a modern wonder of interactive calculation, iterative design,
and complex analysis which can be quite reasonably and economically placed
in the hands of non-technical users.

.B complication (C).  
raging acceptance led to uncontrolled creeping featurism and kitchen-sink
capabilities -- replacing everything from todo lists, graphing, database
management and some production systems.  these systems are now fat, expensive,
and hard to use efficiently.

.B problem (P).  
spreadsheets are now simply magic -- too many capabilities and flexility
combined with complex problems and spaghetti solutions.  none of the safety,
debugging, and testing seem to apply.  i need more -- a fast, light, adaptable,
portable spreadsheet solution.

.B my solution (M).  
tight, keyboard-centric, power-user focused custom solution.  do one thing
and do it well.  pare back funtionality to a core feature set which can be
fully understood and tested, hand off non-core to other tools, and make the
interface more productive.

.B target user (T).  
very technical, well-versed, power user.

.B accepted functionality (a).  
   -- conceptual framework of cells within tabs within sheets
   -- full vi-keys support and a majority of vi/vim features
   -- console/terminal formatting to enforce value and focus
   -- full set of mathmatical operators for functions
   -- full set of core functions, as in lotus, visicalc, and excel
   -- dependency-graph calculation method to avoid issues
   -- cell coloring for interpretation and dependency-awareness
   -- compile calculations to byte-code for speed
   -- fully scriptable using the same commands

.B rejected functionality (r).  
   -- mouse and touchscreen (fuck off)
   -- any formatting other than alignment and numerical
   -- graphing or visual analyses (integrate with other tools)
   -- importing or exporting of special formats (like xls, etc)
   -- large data tables (which should be in a controlled database)
   -- data sorting and filtering (again, database)
   -- reporting and printing (just not a spreadsheet thing)
   -- cell notes to provide details
   -- text wrapping (learn word processors or databases)
   -- variable number of arguments for functions (rare, ambiguous)
   -- any functions that spit out multiple cells (problematic)

.B as always, all my applications must (#).  
   -- run on any linux box from raspberry to cray
   -- stay focused, small, tight, reliable, and secure
   -- forgo sloppy, kitchen-sink languages, like python, java, or perl
   -- stay away from dependency on external code libraries, like boost
   -- only human-readable, 7-bit safe, ascii streams (not database)
   -- have dedicated, maintained, automated unit testing
   -- provide either detailed reporting or logging for debugging
   -- use secure communications between systems where required
   -- clean, clean code so i can maintain after long absences
   -- no international, multi-lang, multi-byte support (freaking ever)
   -- one-hundred percent keyboard driven and centric
   -- operate using modes and windows/panels like vi/vim
   -- follow the yVIKEYS standard to the letter

.B and all applications must provide the following (!)
   -- all tables must be self describing with labels and queries
   -- all data structures must include dumps, reports, and audits

.SH SCREEN DESIGN and LAYOUT
the gyges screen is broken into the following sections.  by introducing this
terminology early, it will make the remaining discussions more clear.

.B formula line.  
the very top line of the terminal window.  the primary function of this line is
to show the contents of the current cell.  since cells are often much smaller
than their contents, this is one of the only ways to see the whole thing.

.B column headers.  
the second line of the terminal window.  each column in the spreadsheet is
labeled with one or two character names.  as you resize and move left/right
different subsets of the horizontal space will be shown.

.B row headers.  
the left side of the terminal window.  each row in the spreadsheet is labeled
with one to four digit numbers.  as you move up/down different subsets of
the vertical space will be shown.

.B status line.  
the second to last line of the terminal window.  this line shows up in
a different color to stand out and is used to display varying information
about either the current cell or the spreadsheet as a whole.

.B command line.  
the last line of the terminal window.  when you are not in search or command
mode, this line will display the current mode and give very terse list of
the options and keystrokes available.

.B working area.  
everything at the intersection of a row (horizontal) and column (vertical)
is the working area of the system.  gyges tries to maximize this space while
still giving enough context and current information.

.B info windows.  
this can be requested to appear on top of the working area to provide more
details.  they are temporary and must be dismissed to continue working.

.B menus.  
while all commands are keyboard-centric, menus can be requested to help if
you can not remember how to proceed.  these menus will be drawn over the
working area and will disappear after each use.

.SH HERITAGE
.B background.  
gyges, the big-limbed, is the youngst of three primeval giant brothers
called the hekatonkheires (hundred-handed).  each brother was extremely
powerful, more powerful than all the titans combined.  and, were impossibly
ugly in a way only something with one-hundred hands and fifty heads can be.

.B parentage.  
these brothers were born of ouranos (father-sky) and gaia (mother-earth).

.B why use this imagery.  
this spreadsheet is named after gyges given the extremely powerful, massively
parallel, and dangerously unconstrained nature of the spreadsheet concept.
